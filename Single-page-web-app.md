## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks

### Advantages

#### Efficiency
When working with a particular framework or library, the Framework or Library enables you to perform some tasks in less time than when working with vanilla JS.

#### Security
Apperently, when you use a Framework or Library, your website has better securety. I don't know why, but apperently that's just how it works.

#### You don't need to reinvent the wheel
Framework or Library are there for a reason. Smart people had a problem, and found a solution for it, and made a Framework or Library. 

### Disadvantages

#### Loadtime
When you need to export a Framework or Library, it increases the loadtime of your website, since it needs to load an extra internal or external script.

#### Learning
When you are working with a new Framework or Library, it takes time before you know the ins and outs of the Framework or Library.

#### Keeping up with the rest
The world is changing rapidly, and so are Framework or Library. It could be that today, your FoL is the best of the best, but tomorrow, it's outdated.

#### Limitations
Every FoL has it limitations, and you are bound by the limitations of the Framework or Library.

### Best practices
Choose wisely. Sometimes using a framework or library can massively increase functionality while decreasing development time, but at the same time does every framework and library it's own limitations.

## Advantages and disadvantages of client-side single page web apps

### Advantages

#### Navigation
The user doesn't need to navigate to other pages.

### Disadvantages

#### Loadtime
When you fit an entire web app in one page, the loadtime increases a lot.

#### Code
When you make a single page web app, your code can become quite long.

## Best practices
It really depends on your intentions with the website if you should make a single page web app or a multi page web app. Choose one that suits your needs.
